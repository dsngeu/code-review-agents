# code-review-agents

Centralized, reusable code-review agents for GitHub pull requests. Write the review logic **once** here; every other repo just adds a tiny caller workflow and gets it automatically. Fix or improve the agent in one place and all repos pick it up.

Current agent: **Security Review** — reviews PR diffs for vulnerabilities using Claude Opus 4.8, posts inline comments + a summary, and @-mentions you on HIGH/CRITICAL findings. Advisory only — it never blocks a merge.

┌────────┐         ┌────────┐     ┌────────┐

```

When a PR is opened/updated in a target repo:

1. The target repo's caller workflow (`pr-security.yml`) fires on `opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`.
2. It invokes this repo's reusable workflow, passing the repo name, PR number, and HEAD SHA.
3. The agent (`agents/security/index.js`) runs on a GitHub-hosted runner:
   - Fetches the PR diff + full content of changed files (skips lockfiles/binaries)
   - Chunks very large PRs on file boundaries
   - Sends each chunk to **Claude Opus 4.8** with a security-focused, language-aware prompt
   - Parses structured findings: `severity`, `confidence`, `file`, `line`, `description`, `fix`
   - Posts **inline review comments** on the exact lines + a **summary comment**
   - @-mentions `@dsngeu` if any CRITICAL/HIGH finding exists (GitHub emails you)
   - Records a **Check Run** (always `neutral` — visible but never blocking)
4. **Fail-open:** if anything errors (API down, bad key), it posts a comment explaining why, @-mentions you, sets the Check Run to `neutral`, and never blocks the PR.

The prompt is **polyglot** — it detects each file's language from its extension and applies the right checks (Node/JS, Python, Go, Java, Kotlin/Android, Swift/iOS, PHP, etc.) plus universal categories (injection, secrets, crypto, auth, SSRF, path traversal…).

## Repository layout

```
.github/workflows/security-review.yml   Reusable workflow (workflow_call)
agents/security/index.js                Main agent script
agents/security/prompt.js               System + user prompts
caller-workflow-template/pr-security.yml Copy this into each target repo
package.json                            Dependencies (@anthropic-ai/sdk)
```

---

## Setup

### 1. Create the tokens

**Anthropic API key** — https://console.anthropic.com → Settings → API Keys → Create Key. Starts with `sk-ant-...`. Make sure billing/credits are set up.

**GitHub Personal Access Token (classic)** — GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → **Tokens (classic)** → Generate new token (classic). Check only the top-level **`repo`** scope. Starts with `ghp_...`.

> `repo` alone covers reading diffs, posting comments, and creating Check Runs. No other scopes needed.

### 2. Add secrets to every participating repo

Personal accounts can't share secrets across repos, so add both secrets to **this repo and each target repo** (`news`, `debrief`, …). `secrets: inherit` passes the *caller* repo's secrets into the reusable workflow, so each target repo needs its own copy.

In each repo: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | your `sk-ant-...` key |
| `GH_PAT` | your `ghp_...` token |

Names must match exactly.

> Scaling to many repos or moving to a client? Use a **GitHub Organization** and set the two secrets once at the org level instead of per-repo.

### 3. Push this repo

Push `code-review-agents` to GitHub on the `main` branch so the reusable workflow exists.

### 4. Add the caller workflow to a target repo

Copy `caller-workflow-template/pr-security.yml` into the target repo at `.github/workflows/pr-security.yml` and push to `main`:

```yaml
name: Security Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  trigger-security-review:
    uses: dsngeu/code-review-agents/.github/workflows/security-review.yml@main
    with:
      repo: ${{ github.repository }}
      pr_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
      head_sha: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
    secrets: inherit
```

Repeat for each repo you want covered. This is the only file a target repo needs.

---

## Testing it

1. In a target repo, create a branch and add a file with deliberate vulnerabilities, e.g.:

   ```javascript
   // test-vulnerabilities.js
   function getUser(userId) {
     db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`); // SQL injection
   }
   const API_KEY = 'sk-prod-abc123def456';                 // hardcoded secret
   function runCmd(input) {
     require('child_process').execSync(`ls ${input}`);      // command injection
   }
   ```

2. Open a PR from that branch to `main`.
3. Check the PR — you should see:
   - A **Security Review** Check Run (neutral)
   - **Inline comments** on the vulnerable lines
   - A **summary comment** with a findings table
   - `@dsngeu` mentioned (because of HIGH/CRITICAL findings) → email notification

**Error-path test:** temporarily set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to an invalid value, open a PR, and confirm the agent posts an error comment + @-mention and the Check Run is `neutral` (PR still mergeable).

## Configuration

### Environment variables (tune per target repo, no code change)

Set these as repo/org variables or in the caller workflow's `env:` if you need to override defaults:

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `MAX_FILES` | `80` | Max changed files deeply analyzed. Beyond this, the highest-risk files are reviewed and the rest are disclosed as skipped. |
| `CHUNK_CONCURRENCY` | `4` | How many chunks are sent to Claude in parallel (speeds up large PRs). |
| `INLINE_MIN_SEVERITY` | `LOW` | Minimum severity for an **inline** comment. Everything still appears in the summary. Set to `MEDIUM` to reduce inline noise. |
| `VERIFY` | `true` | Adversarial second pass that drops false positives. Set `false` to disable (faster, cheaper, noisier). |

### Code constants (top of `agents/security/index.js`)

| Constant | Default | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | `claude-opus-4-8` | Model used for review |
| `MAX_TOKENS` | `16000` | Max output tokens per Claude call |
| `CLAUDE_MAX_RETRIES` | `5` | Retries on transient API errors (429/5xx) |
| `CHUNK_SIZE_CHARS` | `600_000` | Char threshold (~150k tokens) before chunking |
| `MENTION_USER` | `@dsngeu` | Who to @-mention on HIGH/CRITICAL |
| `MAX_INLINE_COMMENTS` | `50` | Cap on inline comments per review |
| `MAX_CONTEXT_FILES` | `20` | Unchanged imported files pulled in for data-flow context |
| `SKIP_PATTERNS` | lockfiles, binaries, vendored, minified | Files excluded from review |

The review criteria and Claude tool schemas live in `agents/security/prompt.js`.

### How it handles tricky cases

- **Large PRs:** files are risk-ranked (security keywords + code-ness beat raw size); top `MAX_FILES` reviewed, rest disclosed in the summary — never silently dropped.
- **Reliable findings:** Claude returns structured tool output (no JSON parsing); inline comment lines are validated against the diff, with per-comment fallback so one bad line can't drop the whole review.
- **Fewer false positives:** the verifier pass refutes weak findings before they're posted.
- **Idempotent re-runs:** each push deletes the agent's prior comments (tagged with a hidden marker) before posting fresh ones — no duplicate spam.

---

## Design guarantees

- **No servers** — runs on GitHub Actions, on demand, only when a PR opens.
- **One source of truth** — fix the agent here, every repo updates instantly.
- **Parallel & independent** — each PR runs its own isolated job.
- **Advisory only** — v1 never blocks a merge.
- **Fail-open** — agent errors never block a PR.

---

## Roadmap

- Additional agents (style/quality, performance) beyond security
- GitHub App auth (for client accounts, instead of a personal PAT)
- Optional merge-blocking mode
